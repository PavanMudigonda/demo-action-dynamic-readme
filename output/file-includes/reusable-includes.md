Inline Includes & Reusable includes dose the same work. but this can come in handy when you are generating template & saving it in the same file
it preserves include comment and will be parsed again when Re-generating the template & contents of that include will be updated

```
<\!-- START file.md --> 
<\!-- END file.md --> 
```
